# Serverless Web Application with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a simple serverless web application using **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon API Gateway**, and **Amazon DynamoDB**. The application manages student records and provides basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality in a fully serverless architecture.  

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:
- Setting up and configuring **DynamoDB** as a NoSQL database.  
- Writing **AWS Lambda** functions to handle CRUD operations.  
- Exposing Lambda functions via **API Gateway** to create RESTful endpoints.  
- Deploying and testing the application in the **AWS cloud environment**.  

## Objective
The main objective is to provide a practical understanding of how serverless components work together to deliver scalable, cost-efficient applications without managing traditional servers.

## Reflection

- Setting up the AWS services was initially challenging, but it helped me understand how different components like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB integrate in a serverless architecture.  
- Implementing CRUD operations gave me practical exposure to working with DynamoDB and handling data through Lambda functions.  
- Testing the API endpoints with Postman improved my understanding of how REST APIs work in cloud environments.  
- Overall, this project enhanced my confidence in building scalable, serverless applications without managing traditional server infrastructure.
